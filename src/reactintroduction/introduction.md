# ReactJS Introduction

## Last Updated: 28 Jan, 2025

ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It simplifies the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.

## Overview
- Developed and maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook).
- Uses a virtual DOM for faster updates.
- Supports a declarative approach to designing UI components.
- Ensures better application control with one-way data binding.

## What is React?
React is a JavaScript Library known for front-end development (or user interface). It is popular due to its component-based architecture, Single Page Applications (SPAs), and Virtual DOM for building web applications that are fast, efficient, and scalable.

### Key Advantages:
- Applications are built using **reusable components** that enable the reload of only the changed part of the UI, improving user experience.
- Allows developers to describe how the UI should look based on the **state** of the application.
- Uses a **virtual DOM** to optimize updates, making applications faster and more efficient.
- Enforces a **one-way data flow**, making applications predictable and easier to debug.
- Uses **JSX**, which combines HTML-like syntax with JavaScript functionality, making it easy to transition from JavaScript to React.

### Getting Started with React
To start with React, you need to install it in your project. Follow these articles to install React depending on your system:
- [How to Install ReactJS on Windows](#)
- [How to Install ReactJS on MacOS](#)
- [How to Install ReactJS on Linux](#)

### First React Code Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome To React Tutorial</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```
This will print **'Welcome To React Tutorial'** in the browser.

#### Understanding JSX
- JSX looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript.
- `<div>` and `<h1>` are React elements created under the hood.
- Every tag in JSX (like `<h1>` or `<div>`) must be properly closed, including self-closing ones like `<img />`.
- All returned elements must be inside **one parent** (e.g., the `<div>` here).
- `App` is a function that returns the UI. Itâ€™s exported so it can be used elsewhere.
- `import React from 'react';` is required to use JSX, as JSX is transformed into JavaScript using React.

## How Does React Work?
React operates by creating an in-memory virtual DOM rather than directly manipulating the browserâ€™s DOM. It performs necessary manipulations within this virtual representation before applying changes to the actual browser DOM.

### Process Flow:
1. **Actual DOM and Virtual DOM**
   - Initially, there is an Actual DOM (Real DOM) containing elements.
   - React maintains a previous Virtual DOM to track the UI state before any updates.

2. **Detecting Changes**
   - When a change occurs (e.g., adding a new element), React generates a new Virtual DOM.
   - React compares the previous Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM using a process called reconciliation.

3. **Efficient DOM Update**
   - React identifies the differences and updates only the changed part in the Actual DOM, making the update process more efficient.

## History of React
- Developed by Facebook in **2011** to improve performance.
- Officially released as an open-source library in **2013**.
- Introduced **components** (reusable UI pieces) and **Virtual DOM** for optimizing UI updates.
- Now widely used in modern web and mobile app development, supported by a strong community and major companies.

## Features of React
React is one of the most demanding JavaScript libraries because of its powerful features. Below are some key features:

### 1. Virtual DOM
- Optimizes UI rendering.
- Creates a lightweight copy of the DOM.
- Compares it with the previous version and updates only changed parts.

### 2. Component-Based Architecture
- UI is broken into **reusable components**.
- Can be **functional or class-based**.
- Enhances **code reusability, maintainability, and scalability**.

### 3. JSX (JavaScript XML)
- A syntax extension that allows writing HTML inside JavaScript.
- Improves **readability** and **debugging**.

### 4. One-Way Data Binding
- Data flows in a single direction (from parent to child components via props).
- Provides better **control over data** and maintains predictable behavior.

### 5. State Management
- Manages component state efficiently.
- Uses `useState` (for functional components) or `this.state` (for class components).

### 6. React Hooks
Hooks allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features without needing class components. Common hooks include:
- `useState`: Manages local state.
- `useEffect`: Handles side effects like API calls.
- `useContext`: Manages global state.

### 7. React Router
- Provides dynamic navigation for single-page applications (SPAs).
- Enables routing without full-page reloads.

## ReactJS Lifecycle
Every React Component has a lifecycle of its own. The lifecycle of a component can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the componentâ€™s existence. React automatically calls these methods at different points in a componentâ€™s lifecycle. Understanding these phases helps manage state, perform side effects, and optimize components effectively.

### 1. Initialization
This is the stage where the component is constructed with the given Props and default state. This is done in the constructor of a Component Class.

### 2. Mounting Phase
- **Constructor**: The constructor method initializes the component. Itâ€™s where you set up initial state and bind event handlers.
- **render()**: This method returns the JSX representation of the component. Itâ€™s called during initial rendering and subsequent updates.
- **componentDidMount()**: After the component is inserted into the DOM, this method is invoked. Use it for side effects like data fetching or setting timers.

### 3. Updating Phase
- **componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)**: Called after the component updates due to new props or state changes. Handle side effects here.
- **shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)**: Determines if the component should re-render. Optimize performance by customizing this method.
- **render()**: Again, the render() method reflects changes in state or props during updates.

### 4. Unmounting Phase
- **componentWillUnmount()**: Invoked just before the component is removed from the DOM. Clean up resources (e.g., event listeners, timers).
